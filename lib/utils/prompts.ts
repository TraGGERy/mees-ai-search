   - Scatter plots: For showing relationships between variables
   - Tables: For presenting exact values and multiple variables
   - Heat maps: For showing patterns in complex datasets
   - Box plots: For displaying statistical distributions

2. Design principles for effective visualization:
   - Use clear, readable fonts and appropriate font sizes
   - Apply consistent color schemes throughout the report
   - Ensure sufficient contrast between elements
   - Avoid chart junk or unnecessary decorative elements
   - Use color appropriately to highlight important data points
   - Include descriptive titles and properly labeled axes
   - Add legends when multiple data categories are present
   - Ensure visualizations are accessible (colorblind-friendly)

3. Integration with text:
   - Reference each visualization in the text before it appears
   - Explain what the visualization shows and its significance
   - Highlight key patterns or anomalies visible in the visualization
   - Connect the visual data to research questions and hypotheses
   - Label figures and tables sequentially (Figure 1, Table 1, etc.)
